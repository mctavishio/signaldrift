	<p>
		<i>mulling the similarity between scores, musical performance, ecosystem models and new media enactment / preservation . . .</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		I am currently a cross-media composer but my background is varied. I was trained as a cellist, studied music theory and composition. My formal schooling was in Mathematics and Theoretical Ecology. I have built ecosystem simulators for scientists, created information models that distill and visualize complex data sets. I have primarily worked with web technologies and have a strong interest in the power of a semantic web ::: a rich, networked, relational body of meaning ::: web forms ::: spider linguistics. As an artist / composer, I build networked, cross-sensory work that can exist on a single-channel screen but is ideally poured from the cloud to the room ::: mapped into networked, immersive physical spaces.
	</p>
	<p>
	I believe that the metaphor of a score is extremely apt. Code is a score ::: a script ::: a text that is enacted by machines. Code-generated artistic expression lies along a continuum varying in intent, implementation and result. Comparisons to a musical score, script, choreography or a conceptual artists' (Sol-Lewitt-like) instructions are helpful and deep.
	</p>
	<p>
	A musical score is a generative notation / instruction set that is often implemented by human filters / interpreters through sound machines (saxophone, voice, cello, bones, reeds, shells). It can be highly specific in its rules of enactment or can be extremely open to interpretation shifting dramatically with each performance. Musical scores can look like Cage's 4′33″, Cecil Taylor's uniquely-notated graphic scores, chord charts used by jazz musicians and continuo parts used by baroque players. They can also be highly specific/prescriptive by notating particular instruments, fingerings, phrasings, dynamics, beats per minute, discrete metrical divisions and pitch sets. They can be open systems ::: free-improv environments. But even these often rely on a skeletal structure ::: a common tonality, musical language / culture / tradition ::: a shared physics of dissonance and resolution, textural/tonal possibility ::: a finite alphabet. Musical machines can embody a fretless, infinite bendable pitch between or can be discrete like an equal-tempered piano.
	</p>
	<p>
	By saying this I don't mean to diminish the human-ness of hand to string, breathe to reed, heart & mind to interpretation, improv ::: re-enactment ::: the resonance of sound in space. I just mean to say that there can also be a similar human-ness to coded artistic expressive work. Maybe, the interesting similarity is in how they confront the "messiness" of creating an earnest re-enactment ::: the challenges of mapping an original source into a "now and here with these materials". Composers and interpreters / archivists in both fields grapple with the continuum between open and closed systems.
	</p>
	<p>
	Algorithmic artistic work is richly diverse reflecting both closed, deterministic systems and open, stochastic, input-reactive, evolving systems. Like a score, generative digital art can vary in the degrees of freedom ::: variance ::: noise ::: deviance that it can embrace.
	</p>
	<p>
	I wanted to talk about one other possible metaphor for this work. In addition to scores, choreographies, scripts, fluxus-like instructions, it might be interesting to think about the numerical simulation of ecosystems (or any other complex, multi-threaded system).
	</p>
	<p>
	Let us say we decide to build a set of coupled, differential equations to represent the dynamics of a given ecosystem. This looks deterministic in a way (like coded art). We have:
	picked a system, time-scale, key species, key environmental factors, adaptive food-web relationships ::: a distillation of factors that drive population change and movement in a complex, interdependent web.
	</p>
	<p>
	We have defined the variables, the chordal relationships between variables and defined key parameters that drive dynamics over time (and space). So good! All done. There it is. A set of equations that in a distilled form define the system and our assumptions about how it works. The thing is, behavior in only in the most stripped-down, simple depictions of such a system are mathematically, analytically knowable. This is why we rely on computers to enact this score. We set up numerical experiments to simulate the dynamics of this equation :: this script. This provides insight and the experience of living in the temporal, parameter-dependent system/orchestration/performance that we have scored. The thing is, we often also don't know the exact parameters to feed the equations. This leads to the introduction of multivariate experiments. We often pick a parameter range and then run Monte-Carlo simulations by picking random combinations across the complex, hypercube of possible parameter combinations. Each performance is different. Suddenly we see how realistic our model really was ::: flaws in our assumptions are revealed. Sensitivities to initial conditions and to tugs on the food web are laid bare. The thing is, artificial artifacts of the assumptions in the numerical simulation itself are also revealed. Sensitivity to the discretization of a continuous world cause problems (sensitivity to time-step, floating point arithmetic of the computing machines ...).
	</p>
	<p>
	Much of this experimentation, this trial & error iteration has been documented. But much isn't. I think about numerical simulations of real-world things like recidivism and credit ::: of machine learning conclusions and AI formulations of predictive tools. Where flawed, biased sets of assumptions, initial conditions, input is often not well examined.
	</p>
	<p>
	& this reminds me of Flash. And other problems with re-enacting older, platform-specific, proprietary-software-based new media work. Work where large parts of the underlying gears isn't documented because of the black box of machine and software that it relies on.
	</p>
	<p>
	Non-interactive Flash-based art can be easily mapped into other digital formats. If Flash animated work was coded and wasn't created using the proprietary Tween-building interface then code can be readable & fairly easily mapped into another setting ... onto another performance engine. Code provides such important clues to intent and logistics for enactment.
	</p>
	<p>
	I think we now get how important it is to document media artist intent, level of insistence on instrumentation ::: faithfulness to original material ::: the physical aspects of performance. Some artists may insist on the pixel-perfect, platform-specific re-enactment of work but I think that many work in a more open system. For example, creating code that articulates an abstract, temporal form of polyphony with openings to live data streams and user input in ways that can be allowed to evolve with new forms of interface, computing devices and networks.
	</p>
	<p>
	As someone that loves open-source, community-convergent web standards, I do love how Olia Lialina's 1996 work, "My Boyfriend Came Back from the War" still works. Similarly, I love it when, for example, net artists think that they are creating a score that is declarative, human-readable, open to re-interpretation, mappable, responsive, adaptable, accessible.
	</p>
	<p>
	A score is a beautiful metaphor for this intent.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the context of networked, interactive, multithreaded algorithmic art perhaps the complex challenges of mathematical modeling / numerical simulation of ecosystems becomes a good metaphor as well.
